# WIP - payload-plugin-places-field

Uses [use-places-autocomplete](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-places-autocomplete) to add a Google places autocomplete field to [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/).

This is a work in progress and is likely to change in the near future when Payload has a JSON field type - https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/discussions/1292

Right now it saves the address as a one liner in a text field and the lat/lon coordinates in a point field.

With the JSON field type, it will be possible to get any of the supported data from the Google places API.
